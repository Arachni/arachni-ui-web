# Experimental/unstable branch -- used for development/integration

This branch is where all development takes place, once its code has been tested and
is considered stable, it is then merged into the `master` branch and released.

Do not be confused by the version of this branch, `1.0dev` is a placeholder
which simply means _next release_.

## Nightlies

For self-contained, nightly snapshot packages take a look at:

## Source

To run from source you first need to setup a
[development environment](https://github.com/Arachni/arachni/wiki/Development-environment).

**After** you've setup a [development environment](https://github.com/Arachni/arachni/wiki/Development-environment),
run the following to checkout the source code of the `experimental` branch and
resolve its dependencies:

    git clone https://github.com/Arachni/arachni-ui-web
    cd arachni-ui-web
    git checkout experimental

    # --binstubs will make the executables of the Framework available under 'bin/',
    # so that you'll be able to run the CLI if needed.
    bundle install --binstubs

    rake db:migrate
    rake db:setup
    script/rails s thin

For seed data (default user accounts etc) take a look in `db/seeds.rb`.

Also, the DB schema is pretty fluid during development so migrate after each
`git pull` and don't be surprised if you'll have to remove the existing schema
and DBs for things to work again:

    rm db/development.sqlite3
    rm db/test.sqlite3
    rm db/schema.rb
    rake db:migrate
    rake db:setup
